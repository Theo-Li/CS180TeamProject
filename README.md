# CS 180 Team Project
Phase 1: 
The first phase of the project consists of building the entire database side of the project including interfaces and test cases. Forward thinking is strongly encouraged. Questions such as: What are we storing? How are we accessing it? What are we calculating? All should be addressed during this stage. HW10 covers techniques on how to make the database thread safe. Remember the database will only be interacting with a single server; however, that server will be interacting with multiple clients simultaneously. A README.txt file is required with each phase and should be submitted in the Vocareum workspace alongside any java files. See documentation below.
